###### Scope

User should be able to....

1. Sign up for an account
2. Create a profile
3. Add credit card info 
4. View recently purchased items
4. Compare cost of purchased item to cost of same item at other stores
4. Ask CC company to reimburse the difference if item is significantly lower elsewhere (possibly able to adjust settings here for what triggers a reimbursement)
7. Create a "watchlist"
8. Have watchlist notify you if price drops below a certain threshold
9. 


##### User Stories
User will log in to his account, select a purchase he has made and the app wil generate a list of comparisons.
The user will set a cost threshold, and if the potential products's cost dips below the threshold a notification will be generated.
The user will then call his credit card company to initiate a reimbursement.

Later changes include connecting the credit card information to the app to automate  certain aspects.
