##### User Stories
User will log in to his account, select a purchase he has made and the app will generate a list of comparisons.
The user will set a cost threshold, and if the potential products's cost dips below the threshold a notification will be generated.
The user will then call his credit card company to initiate a reimbursement.

Later changes include connecting the credit card information to the app to automate  certain aspects.
